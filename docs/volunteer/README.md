# Volunteering

The Energynet Society needs your help!

Except for a minimal support staff, we are a volunteer-led organization.

If you can commit at least 10 hours a week to the Energynet Society, please send your resume/CV and areas of interest to volunteer@energynetsociety.org

We will respond as quickly as possible, but please be patient and we beg your indulgence.  Before we can bring volunteers on board we need to get our paperwork in order!

And... if you are a volunteer with legal experience who can help make that paperwork happen then *please* email dan@energynetsociety.org right now!
