### EN-RFC1 - Request for Comments - Overview & Process

The EETF uses an informal model of published communications known as Requests for Comments.  It is modeled after the very successful RFC process used by the Internet Society.  Please see the Internet Society's [RFC Index](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc-index.html) for an example of appropriate style and presentation.

In the early stages of the EETF it is important to capture and share knowledge in an open forum.  Accordingly, even modestly formalized notes from important conversations or meetings are welcome (e.g. https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6.txt).

Please contact rfc-editor@energynetsociety.org to submit an EN-RFC.  

Pull requests which directly submit an EN-RFC by adding to the energynet/web-ensoc github repository will also be considered.  In this case, please place your EN-RFC in the eetf/en-rfcs/submit directory with a unique (and self-identifying) suffix.  Accepted EN-RFCs will be assigned a number by the EN-RFC editor.
