## Energynet Engineering Task Force (EETF)

The EETF is a loose affiliation of technical experts who are developing the open standards for the Energynet.
### Working Groups 

Working Group 1 - [Reference Model](wg1-refmodel)<br>
Working Group 2 - [Managed DC Power](wg2-dcmp)<br> 

### Energynet Requests for Comments 

The EETF uses a request-for-comments model of technical organization.  

An EN-RFC can (and currently should!) be an informal document that gathers information about a theme or topic of interest.  

Some EN-RFCs also represent draft proposed Energynet Standards, which, when ready, the Energynet Architecture Board may recommend be brought to a vote of the EETF members and advanced to an Energynet Standard.
