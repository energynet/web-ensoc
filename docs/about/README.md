# About the Energynet Society

The Energynet Society (ENSOC) is a Delaware-incorporated 501(c)3 not-for-profit solcial benefit corporation dedicated to advocating for Energy rights and communicating the essence of Energynet to the world.  Our headquarters are in Vancouver, Washington in the United States of America.

The Energynet Society is (very deliberately) modelled after the Internet Society, and due credit must be given to its founders, and the very difficult task they faced and brought to fulfilment.
