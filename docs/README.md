# Energynet Society


As a concept, the Energynet is about our inalienable right to collect, store, buy, sell, exchange, and use Energy -- on our own terms.

The Energynet Society sponsors the technology-oriented [Energynet Engineering Task Force (EETF)](/eetf). This group is charted with solving the technical challenges of bringing the Energynet into fruition. Their initial focus is on DC "managed" power delivery wherein DC Power (e.g. a 12 volt battery) is delivered with a modest amount of communications (10K-100Kbps) to coordinate supply, storage and consumption of power.

Our "back of the napkin" calculations show that managed DC power, along with a modest supply of solar panels and batteries on and in every residence, can generate a surplus of residential electrical power worldwide. An added bonus is that those who are careful with their power consumption should receive payment each month for the excess power they choose to sell.

Through the freedom to sell this power (and buy power at spot-market prices), and by extending this concept into the commericial and industrial arenas, the global consuption of carbon-based power generation can be stopped.

Once carbon-neutral power consumption is attained, the process can accelarate towards carbon-neutral energy consumption (including petrochemical), thus turning the tide on the increase of CO2 in our atmosphere.
